# Client SDK (`crates/auction_sdk`)

The SDK is the only way the CLI (and, in Plan 4, the FFI) talks to the engine. It is synchronous and generic over one trait.

## Chain

`chain::Chain` = `account`, `nonces`, `last_block_id`, `blocks(from..=to)`, `send`. Implementations: `rpc::RpcChain` (sequencer JSON-RPC, feature `rpc`), `testing::FixtureChain` (in memory, feature `testing`), and `WorldChain` in `programs/integration_tests/tests/common/sdk.rs` (the real guests in an in-process `V03State`). An uninitialised account is `Account::default()`, never an error. `send` success means accepted, not executed (spec §3.2).

## Encoding

`encode::words(&ix)` is `lee::program::Program::serialize_instruction` (risc0 serde) of the program's own instruction enum, so the first word is the enum index the guest decodes. Never the IDL position: `idl/stablecoin-idl.json` differs from `stablecoin_core::Instruction` for positions 8..=18 (`STABLECOIN_IDL_POSITION_TO_ENUM`). Signed `i128` controller gains encode (spel cannot, ADR-018).

Drift tests: `encode::tests` (SDK) and `programs/integration_tests/tests/idl.rs`. Both use one shared source for the stablecoin sample set, the IDL-name extraction (`testing::support`, `#[doc(hidden)]`, feature `testing`) and the position-to-enum table (`encode::STABLECOIN_IDL_POSITION_TO_ENUM`); nothing is duplicated.

## Plans

`plan::Plan { program_id, account_ids, signing_requirements, instruction_words }`; `Plan::new` rejects duplicate accounts, unlisted signers and signer-less plans.
